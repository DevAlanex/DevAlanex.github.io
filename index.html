            I'm really excited about learning some new languages, HTML, CSS, JS, to expand on my development skills.
            I hope to learn more and definitely enhance my abilities in debugging and problem solving.
            I'm also really happy to work on some assignments to help create a portfolio.

        <p> The most unique experience I have had would probably be the fact that I was in the Army for 6 years,
            and boy was it an experience.
