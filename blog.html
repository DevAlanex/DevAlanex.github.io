        <p> Hello everyone. Welcome to my blog. This is my first entry, how exciting.
            I found the assignment quite fun because This is my first time ever using HTML.
            I did not encounter any setbacks besides learning all the < > tags. I did have to do a lot of code clean up
            to make it look a lot cleaner and more legible to understand naturally. I would say the most helpful resource I
            on this assignment was one of the class TA's. Not only did they help me understand a bit more of the assignment, but
            they also helped me learn my way around VSCode a little bit more, this is also the first time I'm using VSCode.      
        </p>

        <p> Back again with another post. This assignment was primarily focused around CSS, it was super cool to see
            everything you could do with CSS. This assignment was much more difficult than the first one. I had to rewatch
            the CSS lectures while completing this assignment. I also met with the TA's multiple times to fix little issues.
            One of the issues I could not figure out at all was so strange. I used the "display: inline-block;" element
            and for whatever reason every post container was aligned, but one of them was oddly offset, and none of the margins
            or padding was different between the other posts. I was able to fix by changing the display to flex and utilizing the
            flex-wrap element.

        <p> Oh boy JavaScript is insane! I thought this assignment was quite difficult compared to the others.
            I had to do a significant amount of googling, and reviewing of the lectures to complete it. I also did a little
            collaboration with some of the members in my group for the final project which was also very helpful. Maybe This
            sounds strange, but I really enjoy hanging out and working with them. As this is my first term at OSU they are my 
            first group of friends here.

    <h3> Nov 20th, 2023</h3>
        <p> In the whimsical realm of Node.js, our mission: crafting a web server for Benny's List. The saga begins with a royal 
            decree â€“ a header comment demanding my name and email. The server, armed with MIME type magic, elegantly serves HTML, 
            CSS, and the elusive 404 page. As it encounters the root URL path, a red carpet unfolds, revealing the majestic static/index.html. 
            In a twist of fate, the server transforms into a Shakespearean character, dynamically generating HTML for /posts/<n>. 
            File reads become a clever dance, ensuring files in static/ are read only once. The grand finale: a triumphant 
            log message proclaiming, "Server listening on port <PORT>." And thus, the Benny's List Server emerges victorious,
            leaving a trail of witty HTML in its wake.
