        <p> Hello everyone. Welcome to my blog. This is my first entry, how exciting.
            I found the assignment quite fun because This is my first time ever using HTML.
            I did not encounter any setbacks besides learning all the < > tags. I did have to do a lot of code clean up
            to make it look a lot cleaner and more legible to understand naturally. I would say the most helpful resource I
            on this assignment was one of the class TA's. Not only did they help me understand a bit more of the assignment, but
            they also helped me learn my way around VSCode a little bit more, this is also the first time I'm using VSCode.
